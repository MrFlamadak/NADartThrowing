% task4.m - Investigates the relationship between dart mass and dart-throwing
% velocity in regards to dart-throwing

% Hypothesis
% Our hypothesis is that an increased mass will lead to an increase in
% gravitiational pull. Therefore, the force exerted on the dart in the direction
% of the dartboard must increase in order to compenstate for this. 
% The only variable that affects the force is velocity and so an increase 
% in velocity is an increase in force upwards.

% test1 - high mass, high velocity

% test2 - high mass, low velocity

% test3 - low mass, high velocity

% test4 - low mass, low velocity
