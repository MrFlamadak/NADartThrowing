# Numerical Analysis: Dart Throwing
This is a project made during the course SF1546 Numerical Methods, Basic Course, where we used different numerical methods for calculations in a dart throwing scenario.  

The differential equations 
$$m\ddot{y} = -mg - K_{y}\dot{y}V$$
$$m\ddot{x} = -K_{x}\dot{x}V$$
$$V = \sqrt{\dot{x}^2 + \dot{y}^2}$$
were provided in this specific scenario, where $K_{y} = 0.02$, $K_{x} = 0.002$ and $g = 9.82 N/kg$.
