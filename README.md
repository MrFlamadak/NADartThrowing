# Numerical Analysis: Dart Throwing
This is a project made during the course SF1546 Numerical Methods, Basic Course, where we used different numerical methods for calculations in a dart throwing scenario.  
The differential equations 
$$my'' = -mg - K_{y}y'V$$  
$$mx'' = -K_{x}x'V$$  
$$V = \sqrt{x'^2 + y'^2}$$  
were provided in this specific scenario, where $K_{y} = 0.02$, $K_{x} = 0.002$ and $g = 9.82 N/kg$.
